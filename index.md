## Luciana Brito

I'm a physicist, graduated from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, specialist in e-learning management and master student in Information Systems in the postgraduate program in Informatics at UFRJ. I have been an Instructional Designer for the Rio de Janeiro State Government for almost 6 years, and I have worked as a Physics teacher at the Rio de Janeiro State Government for 7 years. Twenty years ago I started studies focused on science education and since then I have never stopped pursuing my dreams for personal improvement in order to assist in the education of young people and adults in the disciplines related to science, mathematics and their technologies.

One of the most important features of the research and work I have been developing is collaboration. So it is important to know that many people are involved in the projects I participate in, giving them strength, creativity, support and their hard work to make them come true. We are very happy working this way and we intend to continue in this vibe because we feel powerful together.
